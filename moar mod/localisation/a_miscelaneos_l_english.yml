To overcome this problem the achaemenian administration relied on the elamite administration (an inheritance from the kingdom of Anshan), made use of extensive bureaucracy and continue the practice of the assyrians in appointing governors to rule over areas that the king could not, scribes and systems of couriers and royal posts; also with the genius of great rulers such as Cyrus and Darius they managed to establish the satrapal system that was the central pillar of their provincial administration which consisted of large administrative units that had a fixated tribute system that was relative to the province's wealth and which satrap was elected and regulated by the King of Kings but at the same time had enough autonomy to oversee actions that would otherwise be impossible to mantain by a sole person; however other innovation the achaemenids introduced was their approach to multicultiralism as they allowed for the conquered peoples to continue their traditions and giving them a certain degree of autonomy at local levels it was also custom for the persian kings to adopt themselves traditions of their subjects and present to them as another of their Kings and liberators of opression rather than foreign conquerors. In a sense the achaemenids established the importance of local autonomy while at the same mantaining large administrative efficiency and the absolutism (not despotism) of the monarch and his imperial authority by his delegated satraps."
