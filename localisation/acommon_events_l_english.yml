 syncretized_culture.3.d:0 "Romanisation is the name for the cultural phenomenon that happened in most of Western Europe and North-Western Africa that was under direct roman rule, by which local non-roman populations started to adapt roman customs, language and law to their own unique contexts giving rise to regional accents and variants of the latin vulgar that will later on transform in the romance languages and cultures. Roman traditions spread further thanks to the roman public investments, the prosperity of the Roman State and urbanization."

However these are not the most pressing issues as rumors have spread that also during the Invasion of Nubia Cambyses might had killed his brother and successor, Bardiya, due to paranoia of his brother staging a coup against him, stories from these news have already reach the ears of the major Persian nobility and they are now hessitating on what to do about these rumors as the current Bardiya that have taken over as King of Kings has a follower base in Media while some other nobles debate the real identity of this son of Cyrus."

The Medes led by King Cyaxares united the Western Iranian tribes, marched into the Assyrian heartland, won a decisive victory at the city of Assur in 614 B.C and posteriorly sacked the city. Here he met with the forces of the Chaldean King of Babylon Nabopolassar, who had been at war with Assyria for over 12 years. There they united forces by forming an alliance and marched in to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh in 613 B.C. By August of the next year the city had fallen to the coalition. The battle was fierced with the Sagartians and Medes being the decisive factor in the victory but also the ones who most savagely plundered the city; major buildings were severely damaged and the palaces were completely burned down. It was during the sacking that the King of Assyria himself Shin-Shar-Ishkun died while defending the palace.

In spite of this, most of the Elamite bureaucracy is still managed at a local level and control by the Sukkals. A final reform putting all the administration over the control of the Sukkal Makh is necessary in order to finally unite; however, some Sukkals that are dissatisfied with our government may try to break free from us before we could annex them so we must prepare our armies in case of this scenario."

 sukkal.14.b:0 "Allow the settlement in some cities; we need extra manpower"
 sukkal.15.t:0 "Zari asks for the settlement of Chaldeans"
 sukkal.15.d:0 "Due to the Kingdom of Zari being of Chaldean origin, some of his people are now again wanting to settle in that land but in a greater scope. By accepting the requests we could gain some money and manpower for our armies, but this migration could increase Zari's population as well as even changing the demographics of the land. However, since the collapse of the old Elam, our country is already inhabited by various other peoples so the main problem with this settlement are not the Chaldeans but the possible tensions with Babylonia. If we agree with Zari, the other Sukkal will not approve of this action."

Due to the oppresive reign of Assyrians and Lybians throughout Egypt, Seth was demonized as being an evil god of trickery, the lord of the desert and the traitor who killed his own brother, Osiris, and fought against Osiris. Much of this demonization has continued in our rule but since more foreign peoples are integrated into Egypt and with a weak power seat for the priesthood, we could consider to restore Seth in the Pantheon as once again a god for foreigners for the better future stability of our kingdom."
