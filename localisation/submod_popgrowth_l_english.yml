 population_capacity.4.d:0 "Welcome to the submod for Dynamic Population Growth. So far these events will change how the provinces grow its development. A quick summary is as follows:\n1) Total size: each province is given a size between 1 and 10. Basically, how big a province is, and therefore how much (rural/tribal) population it can hold. \n2) Capacity: based on size as well as other structural facts such as terrain, winters, technology, a maximum capacity is found. \n3) Growth: the division of the maximum capacity by the current population (tribal development) gives the growth. \n4) Growth affects how fast the province will gain a new population. So far, the only factor that may improve growth outside of capacity (remember, plenty of things will raise capacity) is Positive Stability. \n\nAs an example, in the base mod the MTTH (in months) to grow 12% or +1 pop is 600 months, 50 years. With this, it will be reduced to 360 months (30 years), or a full generation. It will be lowered if growth is 1.3 (20 years), 1.6 (12 years), 2.0 (6 years) and 5.0 (3 years).\n §OGameplay§!: Options to toggle on/off the submod, to recalculate capacities and growths in your country, and to display total values into your country, for statistical purposes.
