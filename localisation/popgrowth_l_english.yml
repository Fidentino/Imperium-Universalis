Each of the following options let you choose at which development point to apply. \nIf you choose options 8 to 15 dev, there will be a 'simplified' version of the event, also hidden, that applies to provinces between 6 and X development. So if you choose to have the siege won event starting at development 12, then any province between 6 and 12 dev will still have some of these effects. \nThe simplified version means that they will take 5% of loot value and slaves, as well as 10% devastation, but there will be no buildings or population loss. \nChoose the last option for more explanations on how this mechanics works.
