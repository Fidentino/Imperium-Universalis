 egalite_reform_desc:0 "Those who believe in the ideals of Egalité believe that the law, whether it be a rule or a right, applies equally to all people, regardless of faith, social class, culture, and gender. Equally, all citizens should have access to all positions in our government based only on their competence."
 fraternite_reform:0 "Fraternité Ideals"
 fraternite_reform_desc:0 "Not everyone acknowledges the ideals of Fraternité as an ideal of the Revolution, but view it as a reactionary element within our own state who wish to return to the old government.

 legislative_assembly_reform:0 "Legislative Assembly"

 national_constituent_reform:0 "Constituent Assembly"
 national_constituent_reform_desc:0 "The Constituent Assembly was a rough outline of democracy provided by the old government that governed the people in three distinct constituents. By building and expanding upon the old government rather than overhauling it with the new, we may prove to the reactionary governments on our border that we are still a civilized nation and a force for good in this changing world."
 feuillant_reform:0 "The Feuillant System"
 feuillant_reform_desc:0 "There are many citizens and politicians in the Republic who wish to return to the tyranny of an absolute monarchy. However, the Feuillant political group believe in a compromise; that powers in the nation should be split between an Emperor and a President, similar to a constitutional monarchy. By riding the delicate balance between Empire and Republic, we may actually please both the Imperialists and Republicans within our nation."
 two_chamber_reform:0 "The Two-Chamber System"
 two_chamber_reform_desc:0 "For a long time, the Canton system maintained the peace, stability, and independence of small democratic leagues like the Swiss and Swabian Federations. By similarly dividing our legislature into a Grand Council representing the Cantons, and the Senate representing the republic as a whole, we may protect the interests of the individual cities and cultural identities within our nation while still placing the values of the Revolution above all else!"
 absolute_president_reform:0 "Absolute Power of the President"
 absolute_president_reform_desc:0 "While we have members of our nation elected to represent the people of their constituency, we must never forget that it is the President who has been elected to represent all people.

 revolutionary_council_reform:0 "A Revolutionary Council"
 revolutionary_council_reform_desc:0 "It’s become clear that the cult of personality surrounding our ruler is rapidly returning us to the old ways of government. We cannot allow this to happen, so by concentrating power into a council of elected individuals to represent the values of the Revolution, we strip power away from the individual at our state’s head and create another shield against the horror of absolute rulership."

 equality_principle_reform_desc:0 "Although our state holds Egalité as one of its core values, it is clear that we have completely failed in our goal to treat all our people with fairness and equality. The core principle of our nation must be to eliminate the barriers of gender, culture, and social class and ensure that it is known that all people are created equal and a good start to that would be to ensure that religion remains a private matter and does not dictate one’s rights within the state."
 imperial_principle_reform:0 "Imperial Principle"
 imperial_principle_reform_desc:0 "The Revolution has made it clear that our nation, above all others, wields the divine right to hold Imperial Hegemony over all other nations. The states around us are fragile and weak, and it is clear that only by directly controlling these states ourselves will we ensure that the values of the Revolution are enforced on the people."
 equal_electorate_reform:0 "Equal Electorate"
 equal_electorate_reform_desc:0 "We must dissolve all barriers that separate our people and extend the right to hold a political office to all people.

 three_classes_reform:0 "Three Social Classes"
 three_classes_reform_desc:0 "In the days before the birth of the Revolution, the old government attempted to sway the people away from taking arms by allowing three social classes representation within the government; the clergy, the peasants, and the upper class. Perhaps we could emulate this system by organizing our people into an upper, middle, and lower class based on their economic status and creating three distinct political entities within our government to represent their interests."
 military_electorate_reform:0 "Military Electorate"
 military_electorate_reform_desc:0 "Our nation values comradery above all else, and nobody exemplifies the value of being a comrade like our boys fighting on the fields of battle. These are the men who’ve seen the horrors of war and fought alongside their countrymen to preserve and advance the Revolution, and these men should be the ones to rule us. We must alter the requirements to hold an office in our government so that only those who have served in our military are eligible to represent the people within the government."
 president_for_life_reform:0 "President For Life"
 president_for_life_reform_desc:0 "Though many Revolutionary politicians are supporting the idea of a Revolutionary Empire with a hereditary ruler at its head, others are fiercely resisting this idea and claiming that it betrays the very ideals of the Revolution itself. The President is sovereign, and none may supersede the authority of the Presidency. By electing our Presidents to rule for life, we will both secure the absolute leadership the Imperialists demand without completely abandoning the ideals of the Republic."
 government_for_people_reform:0 "Government for the People"
 government_for_people_reform_desc:0 "Egalité, Fraternité, Liberté. All three virtues of the Republic point to one thing; that the Republic exists to serve its people, and for no other reason.

 become_rev_empire_reform:0 "A Revolutionary Empire"
 become_rev_empire_reform_desc:0 "Even in a Republic fueled by the fires of Revolution, it’s becoming clear that political dynasties are being established in our nation.

 legion_of_honor_reform:0 "The Legion of Honor"
 legion_of_honor_reform_desc:0 "Now that we have reorganized the revolution into a hereditary Empire, we must enlist members of our government to adopt noble titles to legitimize our Imperial rule. The Legion of Honor shall be an order of Knights, Officers, and Commanders granted positions of great prestige and nobility by the Imperial Court."
 imperial_nobility_reform:0 "Nobility of the Emperor"
 imperial_nobility_reform_desc:0 "With the majority of the old Nobility of our nation now buried headless in mass graves, the time has come to re-establish our Nobility in a structure more amiable to the Empire’s goals. By assigning noble titles almost entirely to loyalists and members of the Imperial family, we will ensure that the Nobility will never act outside of the interests of the Crown."
 imperial_decree_reform:0 "Imperial Decree"
 imperial_decree_reform_desc:0 "The Emperor rules supreme in this nation and disloyalty to the Emperor is equivalent to disloyalty to the Revolution. All decrees issued by the Empire are of course done so in the interest of the people, the Revolution, and the Empire, and disloyalty shall not go unpunished."
 consulate_reform:0 "A Loyal Consulate"
 consulate_reform_desc:0 "With the fall of the republican government within the Revolution, it soon became clear that a new system was necessary to continue the spread of the revolution. The Consulate filled that void, and perhaps by advancing the powers of the Consulate and liberally dismissing any who object to the Emperor’s rule we will solidify our grasp on all of our Imperial holdings."
 emperor_of_the_revolution_reform:0 "Emperor of the Revolution"
 emperor_of_the_revolution_reform_desc:0 "Our state is the home of the Revolution, and our Emperor is its head. It is only natural then that we coronate our Emperor as the Emperor of all those loyal to the Revolution and rally the people around his divine cause."
 enlightened_monarchy_reform:0 "An Enlightened Monarchy"
 enlightened_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "The ideals of the Enlightenment are the very foundation for Revolutionary thought, and as long as our Emperor does not truly embrace the ideals of the Enlightenment then he does not represent the values of the Revolution. Many would say a hereditary monarchy itself betrays the ideals of the Revolution, but a combination of an absolute monarch and Enlightenment thought shall ensure that none can oppose the ideals of our state."
 become_rev_republic_reform:0 "Return to the Revolutionary Republic"
 become_rev_republic_reform_desc:0 "The Empire has served its purpose of advancing the needs of the people through an absolute government. Now that our mission is complete, we should hand our powers back to the people we have fought so hard to liberate and allow them to choose their own destiny."
 consolidate_power_in_cities_reform:0 "Disperse Power Across the Cities"
 consolidate_power_in_cities_reform_desc:0 "Our government is a strange mix between a Republic, an Oligarchy, and a Monarchy. Trade and commerce are our primary concern and we’re not interested in building a global empire, only making an empire of trade. If we shatter powers in our nation and grant greater control to the Trade Cities, we shall make our trade league much more inviting for the smaller powers who only desire the freedom and economic stability that we can provide."
 consolidate_power_in_doge_reform:0 "Consolidate Power in the Doge"
 consolidate_power_in_doge_reform_desc:0 "For years, our Republic has had its power base divided between the Doge, the Council of Ten, the citizens, and countless other legislative bodies. Each are subject to each other, but the Doge sits at the top of the hierarchy. Our loose government system has been useful thus far in advancing our trade efforts, but as our nation expands across the world, it’s become clear that we must grant the Doge executive powers across all branches of the government if we are to eliminate corruption in our administration."
 custom_positive_piety:0 "Devotion to Legalism"
 custom_positive_piety_desc:0 "The Quran makes it quite clear how our religion should be practiced. It's only through total devotion to Islamic Legalism that we may prove ourselves a pious and dogmatic nation, united by the study of Islamic law."
 custom_negative_piety:0 "Devotion to Mysticism"
 custom_negative_piety_desc:0 "Our state is utterly devoted to Islamic Mysticism, and try as we might to bring followers more to the letter of the law as dictated in the Quran and Hadith, the people of our nation inevitably stray more towards the spiritual aspect of Islamic practice."
 custom_reform_progress:0 "Progressive Politics"

 custom_free_religion:0 "Freedom of Religion"
 custom_free_religion_desc:0 "Many people live as if they are separate and different but are actually all parts of the same whole; our great nation. Although we still maintain an official state religion that may be propagated, Heretics and Heathens alike are our brothers and will be protected from religious persecution."
 custom_same_culture_idea_advisor_cost:0 "Patron of Culture"
 custom_same_culture_idea_advisor_cost_desc:0 "The nature of our culture and our state have become inseparable, and many talented people of our culture come to visit our nation as something of a rite of passage. People of our proud and ancient culture see it as their patriotic duty to service the state, and will gladly due so for far less pay than they likely deserve."
 custom_power_prod_insults:0 "Professional Insult Artists"
 custom_power_prod_insults_desc:0 "Our state employs only those most experienced in the art of the insult. When one is spurned by a diplomat from our nation, it is said that even the mightiest Khans and Kings would run home weeping for their mothers to nurse their deeply wounded pride."
 custom_manifest_destiny:0 "Sharing Our Golden Age"
 custom_manifest_destiny_desc:0 "Our nation is enjoying the longest golden age in history; culture, economics, agriculture, all are prospering like never before within our nation. It would be selfish of us to hoard all this prosperity for ourselves when there are poor unfortunate primitives around the world who could be sharing this great age with us!"
 custom_justify_conflict_cost:0 "Fierce Traders"

 custom_claim_fab_cost:0 "Masters of Whispers"
 custom_claim_fab_cost_desc:0 "We possess the divine right to rule, and that right extends to just about anywhere we choose.

 custom_sailor_maintenance:0 "Soft-Spoken Sailors"
 custom_sailor_maintenance_desc:0 "We are a maritime society, and our sailors are widely renowned for their good manners and gentle nature. It is said that no matter where our sailors make harbor, they are welcomed into the town with open arms. There are even those in our nation who claim they only speak to sailors, for they are the only people worth their time."
 custom_artillery_fire:0 "Golden Cannons"
 custom_artillery_fire_desc:0 "Some would say spending massive quantities of the treasury on cannons made of gold is a wasted expense, but these people are merely unenlightened. By only using the highest quality metals in crafting our cannons, the world will fear the thunder of our barrels."
 custom_coastal_combat:0 "One With the Water"
 custom_coastal_combat_desc:0 "The harsh waves and typhoons of the ocean always seem to be a nightmare for our enemies, but a great help to our own men. Some even believe our sailors are literally bending the water to their will, but such a suggestion is clearly ridiculous."
