The movement was founded by an apprentice to Mahavira by the name of Makkhali Gosala and it's adherents were very dedicated to the ascetic life, to the point that their mendicants and monks were characterised as spending their time naked and fasting. The movement was highly decentralized as according to Jain sutras there existed twelve different sects (named after the twelve disciples of Gosala) and the Ajivika reached it's peak during the reign of Mauryan emperor, Bindusara, as he promoted the religion across his realm and ajivikas were given high official titles that they would retain forming the core of a functionary class. Following the death of Bimbisara the Ajivika movement would decline quickly giving more ground to Jainism and Buddhism with both religions not being very fond of them."

While similar to the Brahmanic religion in the way that the movement practised common ideas such as or the existance of the Devas (in all but Ajivika), Salvation, Metaphysics, Karma, Ahimsa and Samsara it was classified as a heterodox or Nastika philosophy because of it's opposition to vedic tradition and the Vedic literature, instead chosing to create it's own religious canon independent by movement; one of these cases being the buddhist Tripitakas. Sramana was initially popular in the eastern gangetic plain were vedic culture was weaker than in the West, here as a decentralized movement it would sprawl in a variety of new religions such as Jainism and Buddhism or new philosophical movements like Ajivika or Charvaka and it would later expand to the rest of India thanks to the expansion of Magadha as this kingdom was a strong Sramana adherent before the arrival of the Shunga dynasty."

The schism was the result of refusal of the majority group of buddhist monks to modify the Vinaya (Tripitakas containing rules and procedures for monastic life) as the elder gorup of buddhist monks (Sthavira) wanted to add more rules to the Vinaya. By having less rules for monastic life the Mahasamghika were more concerned for the spread of Buddhism among lay communities. They believed that the teachings of Buddha were to be understood as having two principle levels of truth: conventional truths and ultimate truths, they also think that arahants could still posses human weaknesses. In modern times it's believed this school gave rise to Mahayana buddhism."

The elders were more concern with a stricter buddhism and for that reason their Vinaya had more rules. This school would developed later in Theravada (pali for Sthaviravada) buddhism.
