 population_capacity.2.d:0 "Welcome to the menu for Dynamic Population Growth, one new feature added to Imperium Universalis 3.0. \nSo far these events will change how the provinces grow its development. A quick summary is as follows:\nCapacity: based on size as well as other structural factorss such as terrain, winters, technology, and buildings. \nGrowth: the division of the maximum capacity by the current population (development) gives the growth. Everything is separated between the three pop types. \nEach pop type will grow or promote into/from depending on said growth ratio. Value of 1.00 is stable, and over 1.0 will be §Bpositive§! and allow growth or promotions; values under 1.00 (0.90, 0.80, etc) are considered §RNegative§! and pops may demote or migrate to other places.\n §MGameplay§!: You can toggle on/off these mechanics and play the 'vanilla' game, whenever you with. There are also other options for analysis and statistics, once you have started this. "
