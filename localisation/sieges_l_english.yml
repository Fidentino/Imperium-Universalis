So if you can devastate 30% (60% and 50% ratio of soldiers), then you have a chance of harming them with that quantity. Sometimes damage will be more, sometimes less, but at maximum it will be the looting value times devastation %, and at average should be the devastation %. advanced buildings will be demoted, and may be twice destroyed (first lv2 demoted, then lv1 removed). \n\n §RTo add: loss of population (killed) and enslavement, both affecting local development.
