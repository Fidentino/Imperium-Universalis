 cb_indian_subjugation_desc:0 "How ancient indian states conducted expansion and annexation of foreign countries was by completely taking over the land and cities of invaded countries, and seizing all land in one war (no matter how costly it might be). After the country had been fully subjugated, the conquerors would pact with the former ruling class of the land for them to become part of their country, redistributed the land among the defeated to breakup large fiefdoms but guaranteeing their continued position as a ruling upper class just under a new king or ruler. This method of conquest allowed for quick conquests of vasts amounts of land although at the cost of high autonomy for the newly conquered territories."
