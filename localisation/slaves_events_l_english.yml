 #slaves.1.d:0 "Every five years the country will get a certain amount of money from slavery. The amount of money is the depends on your monthly income and your amount of slaves.\n\nProfit from Slavery = (Slaves/100)*(MonthyIncome/100).\n\nAmount of Slaves: §Y[Root.slaves.GetValue]§!\nSlaves to Population Ratio: §Y[Root.var_slaves_pop_ratio.GetValue]% §!"		# old description, stored just in case
 slaves.1.d:0 "Slavery, or any manner of control over other humans, was prevalent in many places across Antiquity. In Imperium Universalis we modeled these interactions with the player: \n1) Contributing a certain % of extra goods produced, depending on their size relative to the normal population and their productivity, 2) Every five years the state will get a certain amount of money from slavery. 3) Slaves can be assigned into manufactories (with enough tech); those won't be counted towards the benefits of sections 1 and 2... BUT \n4) Total amount of slaves (assigned or not) relative to total population will have an impact. The bigger % they become, the worse on social issues (unrest, stability, others) it will be, leading to disasters and even full-scale, Spartacus-like rebellion. \n\nThe extra money is collected every five years in this event, and it depends on your monthly income, the amount of slaves relative to the total population, and global autonomy.\nProfit from Slavery = Monthy Income x 60 (12 months x 5 years) x 33% x \n(Non-assigned Slaves / Country Population x Slave Productivity)% x (100 - Average Autonomy)% -- See more information in the Estates tab. \n\nTotal amount of Slaves: §B[Root.slaves_tot_display.GetValue].000§! ([Root.slaves_mnf_display.GetValue].000 in manufactories, [Root.slaves_oth_disp.GetValue].000 somewhere else)  \nTotal free and citizen population: [Root.var_total_pop.GetValue].000  \n% Slaves to population, for social purposes: §B[Root.slave_pop_social.GetValue]%§! \n% effect on the economy (at §O[Root.slave_productivity.GetValue]%§! prod., not assigned): §B[Root.slave_pop_economic.GetValue]%§!"

We could order them to sack the city and plunder all the treasures, this would hurt our enemy and give us money, but also costs us resources since our soldiers need to search every house and building for loot."

After this murder he and other slaves fled and escaped in the woods and hills, from there the men started to attack local estates and farms and freed more slaves.
