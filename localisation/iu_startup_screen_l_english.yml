 string_start_elam_kingdom_description:0 "The current state of the Kingdom of Elam is not the best as the nation was ravaged and sacked just over 27 years ago, when the assyrians in their full might led by King Ashurbanipal himself mobilized all their army east as to annex and destroy the Elamite Kingdom of the Tahrid dynasty as they had being meddling in assyrian affairs in Lower Mesopotamia and the Zagros Mountains culminating in a babylonian revolt that even saw the death of an Assyrian prince. As this offense was of the highest levels the assyrians took no reserves in leveling to the ground the once former great city of Susa and also other elamite cities, this level of destruction and exhaustion of the elamite army caused a rapid fragmentation of the Neo Elamite empire which quickly saw it's dominions in the very birthplace of Elam, Anshan, fall to migrating tribes of iranians once irrelevant in the geopolitcal scenario bu now known as persians. However this would not be the only loses for Elam as most power would decentralized and former provinces of the empire will declare indepence from Susa forming their own dynasties and naming themselves as Sukkal(King), but this would not have being the total disintegration of Elam in to various petty Kingdoms thanks to branches of the Tahrid dynasty control over large settlements like Susa, Madaktu and Hidali and also the present existential threat of both Iranians and Assyrians that had profited off Elam's collapse, these factors led to those newly found kingdoms uniting nominally for protection under the authority of the Tahrids at Susa recognizing the ruler there as Sukkal Makh or High King a title that used to be proclaim in antiquity showing the contrast between a currently decentralized Elam and it's former highly bureaucratic empire. Though the authority of the Sukkal Makh is fragile and the loss of any other major city would be devastating for the elamite morale, Elam is still one of the world's richest and most populated regions, a sufficiently skilled leadership could possibly unite the Kingdoms of Aiapir, Durum, Gisati, Hidali, Rashi, Samati, Susun, Zamin and Zari in to a coherent elamite entity by slowly reconstructing the administration or by conquest. Historically Elam never recovered with most of the neo elamite legacy being lost and elamite culture, religion and language dying off."

 string_start_government_monarchy_elam:0 "The High Kingdom of Elam is ruled over by a Sukkal Makh who currently resides in the city of Susa and is a member of the Tahrid dynasty who acts as the military leader to a coalition of different minor elamite kings(Sukkal), these Sukkal are bound to give tribute to the Sukkal Makh whose authority is still unstable as he can't fully control the Sukkal's territory. If the authority of the Sukkal Makh becomes too weak, a powerful enough Sukkal might try to replace him as Sukkal Makh, it is also very important for the integrity of the High Kingdom to mantain control over the Capitals of Elam at any cost as losing this cities (specially Susa) will seal the fate of Elam as a fading nation."
 string_start_elamite_region_desc:0 "Haltamti is the elamite name for Elam, the region is surrounded to it's North and East by the Zagros Mountains who posses a fertile soil and a humid mediterranean climate good enough to sustain large cities like Madaktu or Hidali, the South of Elam is dry but not desertic and it's coast is characterized by it's mangrove forest who remain very reduced in size in modern times, the Center of the region is the most populated and important one as it holds the city of Susa and the Pasitigris river(modern Karun) that with it's waters forms an alluvial plain in combination with the Tigris river that sustains the irrigation complexes feeding the population, the North-West is dominated by the Mesopotamian Steppe. In this context the High Kingdom of Elam tries to survive the powers from the Iranian Plateau and the Mesopotamian Valley."
